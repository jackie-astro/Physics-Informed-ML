# Physics-Informed-ML
This repo will contain physics inspired DL, regrading principles of physics, and its application in DL, etc.

## Physics-aware ML Paper and Code

- Physics-aware Difference Graph Networks For Sparsely-Observed Dynamics  [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1gelyrtwH) [code](https://github.com/jqwenchen/PIML/tree/master/PADGN)
  <details><summary>Notes</summary>
        ** Previous code has some bugs, and cannot work with PyG2.0, re-Implement, now compatible wth PyG2.0 **
	
	Physics on continuous Domain + Sparse and irregular observed points = Time Series at obaserved points
