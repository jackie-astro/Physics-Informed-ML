# Knowledge-Awared-ML
This repo will contain multiple topics including Casual Learning, Physics Informed ML, and my understandings to those topics, etc. 

## Physics-aware ML Paper and Code

- Neural Ordinary Differential Equations  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf) [code](https://github.com/jqwenchen/PIML/tree/master/NeuralODE)
  <details><summary>Notes</summary>
	How ODEâ€™s can be used to solve data modelling problems-> solving problems using the muscle power of neural networks.
  </details>

- Physics-aware Difference Graph Networks For Sparsely-Observed Dynamics  [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1gelyrtwH) [code](https://github.com/jqwenchen/PIML/tree/master/PADGN)
  <details><summary>Notes</summary>
        ** Previous code has some bugs, and cannot work with PyG2.0, re-Implement, now compatible wth PyG2.0 **
	
	Physics on continuous Domain + Sparse and irregular observed points = Time Series at obaserved points
